# PyPGN
A pure Python 3 library to simplify parsing and manipulation of [PGN](http://portablegamenotation.com/FIDE.html) (Portable Game Notation) format files, which are often used for serializing games such as chess.

## Prerequisites

Python version `3.x` >= `3.6` and `PiP`

## Install

Install or upgrade with `PiP`

```shell script
$ pip install pypgn 
```

You can also install from source:

```shell script
git clone https://github.com/DaniruKun/pypgn.git
cd pypgn
python setup.py install
```

## Examples

```python
from pypgn.game import Game
# Importing game from file on disk
chess_game = Game('test.pgn')

# Import game from Lichess
chess_game.pgn('dGm3ND39')

print(chess_game.tag('Event'))
print(chess_game.result())
# Print opening ply for white
print(chess_game.ply(1, 'w'))
```

Output:
```shell script
$ Rated Blitz game
$ 0-1
$ e4
```
